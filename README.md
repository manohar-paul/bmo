# Butterfly Mating Optimization
- Implemented a novel swarm intelligence algorithm based on the mating phenomena occurring in butterflies to extinguish the fire accidents in nuclear power plants using drones.
- The algorithm is implemented in Python using 3 peak function and proved with various convergence plots in matplotlib by capturing the local peaks in multimodal search space.
- Experimented with Bflybots using both manoeuvring and non- manoeuvring single signal source and multi signal sources .
